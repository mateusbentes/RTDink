I made this .dls file by converting GeneralUser GS v1.471.sf2 by S. Christian Collins (license in this dir) and 
replacing the drums with the ones from Chaos Bank V1.9.  The reason is that .dls 1 format can only handle one layer and the GeneralUser drums used like 8 and couldn't be converted well.

Some instruments/samples were removed to cut down on size.
